# Cron File Setup

To create cron job you just need to create one js file with some specific format in `schedulers` directory, which is in root directory of application.
There is one `sample.js` file for example in `schedulers` directory.

	module.exports = {
	    name: 'Sample Cron File', //cron name
	    defaultRunTime: '10 * * * * *', //erevy 10th second
	    isOverride: false, // false => cron will not override
	    run: async function (logFile) {
	        return new Promise(resolve => {

	            logFile.info('From Cron'); //to create file log

	            /**
	             * Your logic goes here 
	             */

	            resolve(); //set resolve once your execution completed
	        });
	    }
	}
**Note:** You need to `resolve()` promise once your all execution completed, if you resolve promise before execution you may loss data.

You can create logs in file, log will be created date wise with cron file name and also you can access this log log from UI.

	logFile.info('From Cron'); //information log
	logFile.error('Error while save data'); //error log
	logFile.error({....}); //you can log object also

# Dev Test

Cron job file will run as worker so you will not able to track console log, so using dev module you can track logs.
You can run dev module with below commands.
- npm run dev 
		- This will give option to select file 
-  node dev
		- This will also give option to select file
-  node dev <file_name>
		- This will execute specified file
		- Ex. `node dev sample.js`
